# Disease-Prediction
The Disease Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a patient having a certain disease based on their symptoms. The project will utilize the Random Forest algorithm (Highest Accuracy) to analyze the various symptoms provided by the patient and make a prediction.
